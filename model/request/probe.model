id (integer): The id of the probe,
is_anchor (boolean): Whether or not this probe is a RIPE Atlas Anchor,
is_public (boolean): If a probe is not public then certain details, including exact IP addresses, are not returned.,
last_connected (integer): When the probe connected for the last time (UTC Time and date in ISO-8601/ECMA 262 format),
prefix_v4 (string): The IPv4 prefix if any,
prefix_v6 (string): The IPv6 prefix if any,
status (probe status): A JSON object containing id: The connection status ID for this probe (integer [0-3]), name: The connection status (string [Never Connected, Connected, Disconnected, Abandoned]), since: The datetime of the last change in connection status,
